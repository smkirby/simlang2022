Or, in maths, $p(h|d)\\propto p(d|h) p(h)$. We have already defined our prior and the likelihood, so all we have to do is work through the hypothesis space and calculate this product for each hypothesis; then, at the end, we normalise these numbers, which turns them into probabilities (this is the equivalent of calculating $p(d)$, which is the denominator of Bayes' Rule).

[Harder] We are assuming that candidate word meanings are nice and neat: a word refers to a set of entities that are contiguous in some sense (as represented by consecutive integers: i.e. our hypothesis space includes `{3,4,5}` but not `{3,5}` as a candidate meaning). Calculate the posterior probability distribution using the standard hypothesis space and the data `[3,5]`. Which hypothesis has the highest posterior probability? Now add a \"hypothesis with a hole in it\", `{3,5}` to the hypothesis space and recalculate the posterior. Which hypothesis has the highest posterior probability now, and why? Is there a potential problem here if we are trying to model learning? How would we change the model to disfavour this kind of \"hypothesis with a hole in it\"?\n",
